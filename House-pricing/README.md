# House price prediction
Little project in which I was tasked with predicting the sale price of a house given its characteristics.
Fitted a baseline model using a simple linear regression on the number of bedrooms, then fitted a ridge regression on a variety of features for the final model.
The model had to reach a performance threshold in order to be accepted, which it did.
